# Fortum Fabric BI Platform

This repository contains a set of three demonstration projects designed to showcase modern data engineering, reporting, and governance capabilities using Microsoft Fabric. The work is structured to represent the responsibilities of a Senior / Lead Analytics Engineer within a large energy company operating at scale.

The repository is organised into three primary projects:

1. Energy BI & Analytics Solution (Project 1)
2. End-to-End Fabric Data Pipeline & Automation (Project 2)
3. Fabric Governance, Security and CI/CD Framework (Project 3)

Together, these projects demonstrate a complete, production-aligned Fabric ecosystem including ingestion, transformation, modelling, reporting, governance, operations, and deployment automation.

---

## Objectives

- Demonstrate ability to design, build and operate enterprise-grade solutions in Microsoft Fabric.
- Provide a blueprint for a scalable, governed analytics environment suitable for an energy-sector organisation.
- Implement an end-to-end data flow from ingestion to reporting.
- Showcase best practices in workspace structure, naming standards, RLS/OLS, and deployment pipelines.
- Present a complete and clear documentation package for technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## Project 1 — Energy BI & Analytics Solution

A full business intelligence solution built using Power BI and Fabric semantic models.  
It demonstrates:

- Data modelling using a star schema
- Calculation groups and measure definitions
- Data quality and transformation logic
- A clean, production-ready BI report
- Energy-sector KPIs (production, demand, emissions, district heating, etc.)

The project includes sample datasets, semantic model documentation, and a Power BI report.

## Project 2 — End-to-End Fabric Pipeline

An end-to-end hybrid ingestion and transformation pipeline demonstrating:

- Dataflow Gen2 ingestion
- Lakehouse storage and optimisation
- Notebook-based transformations (PySpark)
- Automated pipelines with dependencies
- Deployment pipeline structure for Dev → Test → Prod

Artifacts include pipeline JSON, notebook templates, dataflow definitions, and architecture documentation.

---

## Project 3 — Governance, Security and CI/CD Framework

This project illustrates how to manage Fabric in a controlled enterprise environment:

- Workspace strategy (Development, Test, Production)
- Naming conventions and certification processes
- Dataset governance
- Tenant-level governance recommendations
- Gateway configuration and data connections
- CI/CD using YAML-based deployment pipelines
- Monitoring model and supporting report

This project reflects modern, mature Fabric governance practices that scale across teams.

## Documentation

All architecture, governance, and design materials are located in `/docs`.

Key documents include:

- Fabric architecture diagrams
- Governance blueprint
- Security and access models
- Naming standard
- CI/CD process documentation
- RLS/OLS implementation guide
- Release procedure

These documents are written to reflect enterprise standards.

## Technology Stack

- Microsoft Fabric (Lakehouse, Pipelines, Dataflows, Notebooks, Semantic Models)
- Power BI
- Git integration with Fabric
- SQL / PySpark
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## How to Navigate This Repository

Start with the `/docs` folder to understand the architecture and governance design.

Then explore each project:

- `/projects/project1-energy-bi` for the BI solution
- `/projects/project2-fabric-pipeline` for the ingestion and transformation pipeline
- `/projects/project3-governance-cicd` for governance and deployment artefacts

The `/website` folder contains optional public-facing material for publishing the portfolio as a static site.
